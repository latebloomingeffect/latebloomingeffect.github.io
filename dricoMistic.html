			<p class="paragraph">
			We all live in a world of reality where we know what is possible and what is
			impossible thus we all have come to accept it. When we want to get away from
			reality, we imagine our own magical worlds where we are able to do all we
			want when we want to. Some of us ask ourselves this question "Are we able to
			make our magical worlds a reality?" that is where being intrigued will come in.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
			In the solar system of Earth where it is peaceful, an odd event is about to occur,
			which will change Earth itself forever unbeknownst. An event called the portal
			jump occurs, transporting Earth to the darkness of the cosmos, where it drifts in 
			the darkness of space. It is then gripped by a force similar to that of its original
			one to a completely new system ultimately making it a foreign planet.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
			As time passes, the planet adjusts to the new solar system and it undergoes 
			alterations, which make it change into a different world. A few years later, it 
			became known as Earthacrismo, which is going to be subjected to Solarmatic
			wars about to take place. After every century, Earthcrismo will be subjected to
			universal wars, which will lead to Ultra-native and Omega-Alpha wars in the 
			future.
