					<div id="bookPage1Bg"></div>

							<p id="bookParagraph1-1" class="bookParagraph" >
							We all live in a world of reality where we know what is possible and what is 
							impossible thus we all have come to accept it.  When we want to get away from 
							reality, we imagine our own magical worlds where we are able to do all we 
							want when we want to. Some of us ask ourselves this question “Are we able to
							make our magical worlds a reality?” that is where being intrigued will come in.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph1-2" class="bookParagraph">
							In the solar system of Earth where it is peaceful, an odd event is about to occur,
							which will change Earth itself forever unbeknownst. An event called the portal 
							jump occurs, transporting Earth to the darkness of the cosmos, where it drifts in 
							the darkness of space. It is then gripped by a force similar to that of its original 
							one to a completely new system ultimately making it a foreign planet.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph1-3" class="bookParagraph">
							As time passes, the planet adjusts to the new solar system and it undergoes 
							alterations, which make it change into a different world. A few years later, it
							became known as Earthacrismo, which is going to be subjected to Solarmatic 
							wars about to take place. After every century, Earthacrismo will be subjected to
							universal wars, which will lead to Ultra-native and Omega-Alpha wars in the 
							future.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph1-4" class="bookParagraph">
							In the planet Earthacrismo, lives three different inhabitants, which are firstly
							the Crismozians, who are composed with supernatural abilities and are superior.
							Secondly are the Earthacriz, who are inferior to the Crismozians but superior 
							than the next inhabitants that they live with and amongst. Lastly are the 
							Earthlings, who are inferior and undermined by both the Crismozians and the 
							Earthacriz because they do not have supernatural abilities as they do or possess.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph1-5" class="bookParagraph">
							Amongst the Earthlings, one character will defy the meaning of evolution and 
							stand out from the counterparts, and he himself is defiant by nature. In a small
							town of Eartha-global dwells Edmarko Drago, who since childhood was and is 
							still undermined by almost all the people in his society. As he matures his 
							parents, Dekamida and Teselna Drago argue and regard him as a disgrace to 
							them unlike other children.
							</p>

						<h4 id="page2">Page 2</h4>
						<div id="bookParagraphBg2"></div>
							<p id="bookParagraph2-1" class="bookParagraph">
							At school, his situation escalates to a drastic point as he is constantly bullied, 
							teased and mocked at every part of the school. Denver Diaklo, a bully known by 
							the whole school has taken pleasure in bullying Edmarko ever since the first day 
							of school, leaving Edmarko disturbed. There is a girl who is admired by the 
							whole school whose name is Thamgna Ethagos and she is very self-centred.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph2-2" class="bookParagraph">
							In the early days of school, Edmarko notices Thamgna but he is not attracted as 
							other boys at school are to her. It is rather difficult for Edmarko to have friends
							as he is used to being alone and isolated from the rest of the school. As this 
							situation continues, a few individuals spot him but only after midyear will they 
							befriend him as they are like him.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph2-3" class="bookParagraph">
							Felinadgo Obliga, who like Edmarko is alienated by the rest of the school, first 
							befriends him and midyear passes. They both get along and with time they cope 
							with each other and in a process, they form a strong friendship together. 
							Asilnago Tegna, who is cast out by her friends for not being able to fit 
							their standards, next befriends Edmarko.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph2-4" class="bookParagraph">
							Then he is befriended by Ekalga Diamus, a Crismozian Elga who is not like his 
							brother Imigka, a Gela Crismozian. Lastly he is befriended by Kumaglo Onklo, 
							an Earthacriz who does not like to fit in with most beings but prefers been odd.
							They all start to get along and understand each other forming a very strong 
							bond together as friends and begin an adventure.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph2-5" class="bookParagraph">
							Day by day Felinadgo, Asilnago, Ekalga and Kumaglo slowly grow in terms of 
							their abilities, behaviour and natural selection. Therefore, in simple terms they
							are evolving while Edmarko on the other hand has to trigger his evolutionary 
							process. The process of evolution that he will trigger will have its own 
							boundaries unlike the natural order of evolution.
							</p>
					<div id="bookPage3Bg"></div>
						<h4 id="page3">Page 3</h4>
						<div id="bookParagraphBg3"></div>
							<p id="bookParagraph3-1" class="bookParagraph">
							Felinadgo first discovers his abilities are flexibility and agility, which classify 
							him as an Earthacriz and is also known as the middle class. This occurs while he 
							runs from Denver in the alley when he is in the fourth grade and he is driven by 
							fear. When his speed exceeds normal he jumps to the sky and fails to keep calm, 
							falling from the sky his hands stretch out wide.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph3-2" class="bookParagraph">
							Asilnago develops a psychic mentality and a telepathic ability during an 
							argument with her parents, in her anger. To top it off she becomes a Cilciago, a 
							being with an additional fairy like ability and is ranked in the Crismozian 
							category. The occurrence reveals itself at school as well during midyear as she 
							became uncontrollable both mentally and physically.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph3-3" class="bookParagraph">
							Ekalga followed the path of the ancient Gigantus as he developed in height and 
							super strength as he became humble. He also trained himself in alteration, which 
							has become his additional ability ranking him in the Crismozian category.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph3-4" class="bookParagraph">
							At the last day of the last grade all the people in Dekilagon School proceeded to 
							high school while others did not. Amongst the ones who did not proceed was 
							Edmarko Drago, whose parents were obviously miserably disappointed in him.
							Edmarko became a nobody to an extent that no one even recognized him anymore 
							and it was about to alter soon.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph3-5" class="bookParagraph">
							Edmarko, knowing he did not procced to high school he went up to his room to 
							argue with himself mentally. Two days pass and a rumour is revealed that 
							Dekilagon School is being closed and no being is to enter the premises. Edmarko 
							grows curious as to why Dekilagon is being closed down. Upon five days 
							passing on after the closing down of Dekilagon, Kumaglo Onklo appears in the 
							dreams and presence of Edmarko.
							</p>
							
					<div id="bookPage4Bg"></div>
						<h4 id="page4">Page4</h4>
						<div id="bookParagraphBg4"></div>
							<p id="bookParagraph4-1" class="bookParagraph">
							This occurrence grabs the attention and curiosity of Edmarko regarding the 
							repetition of Kumaglo’s pleading for assistance that he does not understand. 
							"Edmarko, only you can help me, please assist me!" as Edmarko hears the 
							pleading he decides to investigate what is really going on to Kumaglo. The next 
							day in the evening, Edmarko sees Kumaglo as a shadow that leads him to 
							Dekilagon School where Edmarko goes in pursuit of the shadow.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph4-2" class="bookParagraph">
							As Edmarko walks in the hallways of the school, he sees that which his sight 
							cannot realize and senses a deep presence that longs for its release. Fear had 
							packed its bags and left Edmarko as his curiosity hungered to be answered and 
							gain knowledge of the purpose Kumaglo has brought him to find. Edmarko had 
							uncovered secrets that he could not comprehend as he continued unrevealing the 
							secrets that lie in the school itself continuously.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph4-3" class="bookParagraph">
							Finding that there have been events of horrific magnitudes that have occurred in 
							the school as Edmarko is taken to the past in memory still pursuing the shadow. 
							It leads him to the one place where he is curious and in a process becomes eager 
							to find out what lies behind the door. He opens the door slowly and he finds 
							souls of all who are trapped in chains, and there is one soul that differs from 
							others.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph4-4" class="bookParagraph">
							In the middle of the room, chained with unstoppable strength that grips his 
							curiosity with hunger for questioning and gathering knowledge. He moves closer 
							and recognizes that the Kumaglo Onklo he knew was just a puppet and the real 
							Kumaglo Onklo is sitting in the middle of the room. Edmarko’s mind lingers 
							with questions and his curiosity becomes a short-lived obsession, which shows in 
							his expression "Edmarko, a story is to be told to you."
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph4-5" class="bookParagraph">
							"A story I would like to hear." Edmarko replied as disbelief exited his mind and 
							he sat down face to face with the true Kumaglo Onklo in participation. "I was 
							once like you Edmarko." Kumaglo Onklo replied. “Please fill me with knowledge 
							as to what happened Kumaglo." Edmarko said in interest of the story. Kumaglo 
							Onklo continued "It all occurred this very day as they all ascended from 
							Dekilagon to Medlagna high, around the beginning of the school itself."
							</p>
					
					<div id="bookPage5Bg"></div>
						<h4 id="page5">Page5</h4>
						<div id="bookParagraphBg5"></div>
							<p id="bookParagraph5-1" class="bookParagraph">
							Edmarko sees the anger and rage portrayed in the soul, that has been tricked 
							and betrayed, but Kumaglo sees young Edmarko eager and willing to listen. 
							Kumaglo continues, "I had friends who were with me and after they headed to 
							Medlagna high, that is when the tragedy occurred for me sadly. My parents 
							were tied up in poles of wood and were carried by the Kiadokara to the 
							Diakolibaos that is now known as the woods I believe."
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph5-2" class="bookParagraph">
							Edmarko replied, "Many talk of these woods but none have encountered them." 
							Kumaglo continued, "There, my parents were fed to the Tegas and they came 
							back. The next day the Kiadokara came for me and they placed a curse that 
							robbed me of my freedom and body, living only my soul in these chains." Once 
							more Kumaglo was angered as he tried to free himself off the chains with the 
							tremendous strength portrayed from his arms and power felt.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph5-3" class="bookParagraph">
							Edmarko replied once more "Olmigalo Kumaglo, the rest of the story I would 
							like to hear of sir." Kumaglo calmed down and spoke again "Time passed the 
							Kiadokara and my parents revealed that they are enemies of my true parents and 
							as I was the last of the bloodline, it was significant that I was erased for good 
							to end my bloodline as a whole." As Kumaglo finished speaking, he angered 
							again and his strength became more and more but not enough to break his 
							chains.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph5-4" class="bookParagraph">
							Edmarko intrigued by the story he has heard he stood up and asked one 
							question, "The chains be not ordinary, whom were the chains made by?" 
							Kumaglo calmed by the question responded by the name of the chains 
							"Delkitago Chains" and Edmarko knew what to do for Kumaglo to survive the 
							destruction of the school but did not tell Kumaglo his plan. Edmarko then went 
							out of the school before he was noticed by anyone.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph5-5" class="bookParagraph">
							The next day the whole of Eartha-global assembled for the destruction of the 
							school as it was the destruction of Kumaglo, which was unknown to the people. 
							Edmarko on the other hand had knowledge of this event and suddenly a voice of 
							plead spoke in Edmarko that was Kumaglo and he listened. Edmarko replied to 
							Kumaglo "On my chest an oath I make to you" after that, the destruction of 
							Kumaglo and Dekilagon happened quickly.
							</p>
					<div id="bookPage6Bg"></div>
						<h4 id="page6">Page6</h4>
						<div id="bookParagraphBg6"></div>
							<p id="bookParagraph6-1" class="bookParagraph">
							All spoke of about the destruction of Dekilagon and a few assumed it the end of 
							Kumaglo except for Edmarko, a minor, considered an Earthling and a disgrace. 
							A plan Edmarko had but to put it in action is timely and secret it has to be for 
							Kumaglo shall become whole and lively again in time. Edmarko disappears to 
							the outdoors of nature in his own quest unbeknownst to him.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph6-2"class="bookParagraph">
							Time went on as he was drowning in his thoughts that consumed him even 
							though regarding himself, there was nothing he could do to alleviate it. His 
							actions are altering unknowingly to his usual actions, exceeding normality but 
							Edmarko was not aware as he considered the actions normal to him. At the 
							correct time his body slowly triggers Edmarko’s evolution without him knowing 
							by thinking of nothing and implementing action, he is beginning to ascend.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph6-3" class="bookParagraph">
							As Edmarko was running in the fields of nature his evolution began to take 
							shape, which compared to other beings is not normal or in other words usual. 
							Instead of gaining abilities that put him in a category, he has surpassed the 
							boundaries in having no limits thus entering boundaries of limitlessness. Time 
							had truly passed but to Edmarko it had felt like only months or days that have 
							passed, it can be said his mind be full of trickery.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph6-4" class="bookParagraph">
							Upon his return from the fields, his instincts are alerted with a feeling that 
							beings are present in his home along with his parents, which was unusual. As he 
							approaches his home, a feeling of unease commanded him to enter at the front of 
							his home, as he was intrigued in doing so. When he enters the front door of his 
							home, he is surprised at the beings that are present along with his parents the 
							moment he is inside.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph6-5" class="bookParagraph">
							Edmarko then went to his room up the stairs as the occurrence of the Ultra 
							natives lingers in his thoughts in terms of their purpose for being present. He 
							had gathered knowledge that whomever sees an Ultra native, death follows 
							them, devastation is worse when there is more than one of them. Confusion 
							upon confusion enters Edmarko’s mind tying thought on thought as if he is 
							drowning in an endless illusion that he is not able to escape.
							</p>
					<div id="bookPage7Bg"></div>
						<h4 id="page7">Page7</h4>
						<div id="bookParagraphBg7"></div>
							<p id="bookParagraph7-1" class="bookParagraph">
							He hears the door open and shut "Edmarko! To the lounge you must come." 
							Edmarko is called by his mother Teselna and continues to the lounge. "Disgrace
							is understated. To Medlagna high in rising sun you shall proceed to Son." 
							Dekamida, his father tells him and he nods in agreement with his parents. 
							Edmarko looks at his parents and is eaten by assumption as to how did they 
							come to conclusion that he will go to Medlagna high unexpectedly.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph7-2" class="bookParagraph">
							Edmarko went to his room to pack his belongings to be ready to go to Medlagna 
							high in rising sun to proceed his mind is in factual thought. The rising sun 
							arrives and Edmarko already waits at the door with factual thought of 
							isolation that lingers in his mind seeing his parents. The bus arrives to take
							Edmarko but his parents do not appear to bid farewell to him and he continues 
							to enter the Medlagna bus.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph7-3" class="bookParagraph">
							Edmarko overhears comments that other students make of him but his head 
							turns towards the window and the bus proceeds in flight to the woods. 
							Unknown to him a trial awaits him in the woods in which no earthling has ever 
							dared to enter and no earthling has entered them. As he arrived to the woods, his 
							realisation of the woods came into play but there was no sign of fear in him 
							unlike other earthlings in Earthacrismo.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph7-4" class="bookParagraph">
							He then observes the surroundings in which he is in and he proceeds to the 
							woods as not only he was considered and Earthling but it was his trial. The 
							feeling of unease told him to return but hesitance commanded him to proceed 
							which he done without wasting time fearlessly.
							</p>
							
							<p id="bookParagraph7-5" class="bookParagraph">
							The path that Edmarko was to travel seemed impossible as it lived up to its 
							name, the woods of no return but alteration was to take shape. Every step he 
							takes makes it seemingly impossible but Edmarko will be the first Earthling to 
							make it alive but it is yet to be. Many tell of the creatures that lurk in the 
							woods of no return to be vicious by action and deceiving by nature, Edmarko 
							was yet to find out.
							</p>
					<div id="bookPage8Bg"></div>
						<h4 id="page8">Page8</h4>
						<div id="bookParagraphBg8"></div>
						<p id="bookParagraph8-1" class="bookParagraph">
						As Edmarko was walking in the dark path called the woods of horror, he hears 
						and feels his flesh tear from the bite of a Tega. The wound inflicted on Edmarko 
						contained poison, which meant death for Earthlings but strangely, to Edmarko 
						it was red and harmless to him. He then faced the Tega, a wolf-like hybrid, 
						which was a combination of a cat and hyena as it was acting rather unusual to 
						him.
						</p>
						
						<p id="bookParagraph8-2" class="bookParagraph">
						He noticed that the Tega was glowing pure red and it was weak which made 
						Edmarko curious enough to take a closer look at the Tega. He noticed that the 
						Tega was weak and a crystal called the Deadly red, which was close to the 
						Tega’s heart seen due to the red bright glow. Edmarko, without thought of 
						decision, took out the deadly red, and it caused him to feel weak and he passed 
						out seeing the Tega dragging him.
						</p>
						
						<p id="bookParagraph8-3" class="bookParagraph">
						Not knowing how many days or months passed Edmarko wakes up slowly but 
						surely and finds himself in a strange place glowing red with crystals. Rising 
						from the decay, he notices that he is not well due to the wound inflicted by the 
						Tega and comes to his realisation that he is in a den. He sees a full pack of 
						Tegas, which are weak and fading in colour abnormally.
						</p>
						
						<p id="bookParagraph8-4" class="bookParagraph">
						Edmarko then got out of the decay pit and moved towards the glowing, 
						intensifying red glow as he was slowly walking towards the Thekirakira. There 
						he saw what many were not able to see, the Silkiatega, which was described as 
						legend and inside it, there was the Ultra-omega crystal inside. The Ultra-omega 
						crystal lied between the spinal cord and entering the Silkiatega’s heart.
						</p>
						
						<p id="bookParagraph8-5" class="bookParagraph">
						The heat felt was immensely strong and it had a sluggish structure, which was a 
						problem because no being in the universe could even touch the Ultra-omega 
						crystal. Edmarko, even though he was weak, held the Ultra-omega crystal by 
						piercing into it and slowly removed it by lifting it upwards allowing the 
						Silkiatega’s heart to heal. As he slowly pulled the Ultra-omega crystal out of 
						the Silkiatega completely, the Silkiatega healed completely with him still 
						holding the rare crystal.
						</p>
					<div id="bookPage9Bg"></div>
						<h4 id="page9">Page9</h4>
						<div id="bookParagraphBg9"></div>
						<p id="bookParagraph9-1" class="bookParagraph">
						Feeling the crystal affecting him Edmarko walked towards the outside of the 
						den and saw the Frogalo pond as he felt heavy then he threw the Ultra-omega 
						crystal inside it. As weakness grew in Edmarko, it forced him to pass out as the
						den became pure blue returning all the Tegas to normal state but Edmarko’s 
						wound was healed. Voices on voices is all Edmarko heard as he gained 
						consciousness and slowly opening his eyes to see the Tegalins sleeping beside him 
						but a sound woke the Tegalins.
						</p>
						
						<p id="bookParagraph9-2" class="bookParagraph">
						Fearfully terrified by the sound the Tegalins ran away as the stepping sounds 
						get closer. Edmarko sees the true form of the Silkiatega but it is surprised 
						Edmarko lost fear. The Silkiatega saw no fear in him and telepathically 
						Edmarko hears “The being be worthy of initiation.” Edmarko’s curiosity was 
						struck immediately. Three months passed and the ancient Tegas initiated 
						Edmarko with Onikidigo. That is where Edmarko learned how ancient the 
						Tegas are and they are also known as Teglagon.
						</p>
						
						<p id="bookParagraph9-3" class="bookParagraph">
						The fifth month, Edmarko proceeds to the other side with an oath of never 
						speaking about anything related to the Tegas seeing the red glow vanish. 
						Edmarko saw the Frogalintus, which are energy-absorbing creatures that thank 
						him for feeding them the Ultra-omega crystal, which is rare delicacy. Edmarko 
						then proceeded to a den that he had never heard of but by name, the Kumaglo 
						lair, which reminded him of Kumaglo Onklo, his friend. Upon entering the lair, 
						he feels ground-shaking steps and recalls his mother’s story of the beast without 
						remorse and he knows he will see it this day.
						</p>
						
						<p id="bookParagraph9-4" class="bookParagraph">
						The ground shook even more as he saw a huge muscular figure that approached, 
						according to legend, this creature strikes fear into its prey just by looking. From 
						the shadows, Edmarko saw an evolved monstrous body of an Earthacriz but 
						not just any but Kumaglo Onklo’s body living questions lingering in his mind. 
						Edmarko fought the beast almost endlessly even though Edmarko got weaker, 
						he fought without fear in him but the beast grew fear in itself.
						</p>
						
						<p id="bookParagraph9-5" class="bookParagraph">
						The fight lasted two months, which is when the beast surrendered, as it could 
						not retain the body and its growing fear of Edmarko where it saw a different 
						being. It then hid away from him and Edmarko spent another five months in 
						the Kumaglo lair before proceeding to the waters of illusion just ahead. He 
						prepares for the waters of illusion for an extra two months and on the last 
						month, he swims deep into the waters of illusion where it occurs.
						</p>

						<h4 id="page10">Page10</h4>
						<div id="bookParagraphBg10"></div>
						<p id="bookParagraph10-1" class="bookParagraph">
						Edmarko sees the Slanidga, a completely ancient aquatic creature, which 
						according to history was and has been extinct for a Crismozian centurion. Both 
						Edmarko and the Slanidga engage in a fight but at this point Edmarko becomes 
						weaker due to not being adapt to the water and ends up unconscious. The next 
						day he is still unconscious, an unseen entity drags him towards the end of the 
						woods with the year of trial complete, Edmarko wakes up on the other side.
						</p>
						
						<p id="bookParagraph10-2" class="bookParagraph">
						Edmarko’s body is far but deep in terms of his unique evolution but he is still 
						unaware of it walking towards Medlagna high, shadows appear going towards 
						him. As he walks, the shadows become visible and there, the Ultra-Natives 
						stand towards him to show congratulations but Edmarko does not pay 
						attention to them and passes. Nearer he gets to the Medlagna high school, he 
						passes students, and amongst them are the ones who disgraced him, as they are 
						amazed that Edmarko passed the woods test.
